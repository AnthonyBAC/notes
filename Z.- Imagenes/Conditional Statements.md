1. **Useful to create sections of the program which are only executed in certain situations.**
```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age > 17:
    print("You are of age!")
    print("Here's a copy of GTA6 for you.")

print("Next customer, please!")
```

2. **Comparison Operators**
|Operator|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`==`|Equal to|`a == b`|
|`!=`|Not equal to|`a != b`|
|`>`|Greater than|`a > b`|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal to|`a >= b`|
|`<`|Less than|`a < b`|
|`<=`|Less than or equal to|`a <= b`|

3. **Boolean values and Boolean expression**
	A **boolean value** is a type of data that can only be **True** or **False**.
		In programming, **boolean values** are mainly used to:
			- **Control decisions** (`if`, `while`, etc.)
			- **Check conditions** (like `5 > 3` â†’ `True`)
