# Variables

**let** 

Variables can be declare using [let] 

let name = "Jhon"

console.log(name);

also variables can be reasign 

- Example
    
    let age = 11;
    console.log(age) //outputs 11 to the console

    let age = 54;
    console.log(age); // outputs 54

Varoables can be declare with [const]

const cant be re-assign and will trow an error if we try

- Example
    
    const pi = 3.14;
    pi = 10;

    console.log(á¹•i) // it will throw an error

There is also a third way, [var] which was the original way variables were declared in Javascript. similar to let.
